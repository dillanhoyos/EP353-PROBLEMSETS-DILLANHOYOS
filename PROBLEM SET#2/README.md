####Purpose 

The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to use Github, Markdown, and compile a C program using CLI.

### Problem 2.1: printf()
Create a file named ProblemSet2.1.c.

Write a C program that prints out the following print lines only with a single printf function:

  To be, or not ot be:
          that is the question.
                          -- Hamlet
The first line has no indentation, the second line has two indentation, and third line has six indentation.

Please do not use multiple printf functions but only one for this problem.

### Problem 2.2: Display Variable Values (integer)
Create a file named ProblemSet2.2.c.

Create integer type variables named note, velocity, and channel.

Initialize note with the value of 36.

Initialize velocity with the value of 89.

Initialize channel with the value of 6.

Print out the values of note, velocity, and channel to look like the following:

  This MIDI note consists of:
      Pitch:         36
      Velocity:     89
      Channel:     6
      
      ### Problem 2.3: Display Variable Values (float)
    
Create a file named ProblemSet2.3.c.

Create float type variables named frequency and decibel.

Initialize frequency to 65.406.

Initialize decibel to -21.8.

Print out the value of frequency and amplitude to look like the following:

  This sine tone has:
      Frequency of 65.406Hz
      Decibel level of -21.8dB
The numbers need to be printed exactly as appear above without any extra digits after the decimal point.

Hint: Use .precision to specify the minimum number of digits to be written after the decimal poin

#### Acknowledgment 
I used the Markdown Cheatsheet on GitHub to figure out the syntax for Markdown.
