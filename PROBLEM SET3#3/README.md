####Purpose 

###Problem 3.1: Operators
Create a file named ProblemSet3.1.c.

Include math.h in the program.

Create a char variable named loudness that holds a decibel level between -120 ~ 0.

Create a float variable named amp that holds the value of amplitude corresponding to the decibel level that the loudness variable holds.

Use the decibel-to-amplitude conversion equation found in the Chapter 2.2.2 in the Audio Programming book to convert a given loudness to a corresponding amplitude value.

Use the pow() function from math.h to implement the equation.

Print the original loudness level and the converted amplitude value using printf().

Here is an example output:

  The Loudness of -70dB is 0.0003548.
  
###Problem 3.2: Conditions
Create a file named ProblemSet3.2.c.

Create a character variable named note and assign an arbitrary musical note between 'C' and 'B'.

Write a program that translates this arbitrary note into pitch classes (0 ~ 11) using the switch statement.

A note 'C' should be 0, and a note 'B' should be 11.

Assign the resulting pitch class to a variable named pitchClass and print out the result.

Since character data type can only hold one character at a time, notes with # and b do not need to be implemented in this problem. Only the white keys on a piano need to be implemented.

Read the chapter 0.7.5 in the Audio Programming Book for some hints.

You do not need to use scanf for this problem.

Here is an example print output from this program:

  A note 'D' translates to 2 in pitch class.
  
###Problem 3.3: Loop
Create a file named ProblemSet3.3.c.

Write a program that uses for loop to print out all musical notes in an octave in ascending steps.

The incrementing variable for the for loop should start at 0 and end at 11.

Make sure to also print out the flat notes, and use the switch statement to implement this problem.

Read the chapter 0.8.3 in the Audio Programming Book for some hints.

You do not need to use scanf for this problem.

Here is an example print output for this program:

  C Db D Eb E F Gb G Ab A Bb B.
  
### COMMENTS
Great problemset I like the Audio Programing Book.
