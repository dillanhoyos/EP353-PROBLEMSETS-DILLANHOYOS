####Purpose 
The purpose of this problem set was to understand how to use Github, Markdown, and compile a C program using CLI.
#### Description
The Problem Set 1.1 covered how to use the Git versionn controlsystem with Github. I had to learn the basic terminology, such as commit, pull, and push, used in Git/Github to understand how to version control software. the pProblem Set 1.2 was about writing documentation using Markdown. In it, we were required to use syntax such as `#`, `*`, and `--`to format the `README.md` file so that the file is formatted nicely on Github when it is displayed. Finally, the problem SET 1.3 was about writing a C program that prints out "Hello World". I had to make sure that the program compiled and ran through CLI. 
#### Build and Run Commands
The Problem Set 1.1 and 1.2 do not require any build and run commands. To build Problem Set 1.3, use:
> clang helloworld.c -o helloworld.
 github 
To run the compiled `helloworld` program, use :
>./helloworld

#### Acknowledgment 
I used the Markdown Cheatsheet on GitHub to figure out the syntax for Markdown.
