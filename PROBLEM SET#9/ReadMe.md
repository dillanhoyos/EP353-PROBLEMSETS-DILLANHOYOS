### ProblemSets 
Problem 9.1: create program that writes noise in to a .wav file.

Problem 9.2: create a program that writes 32nd harmonics of 10% Pulse Wave into a .wav File.

### Build and Run commands

For Problemset 9.1 and 9.2, clang the file in the Terminal and then ./a.out so see the results.
clang file.c
To run the compiled file program, use:

./a.out
