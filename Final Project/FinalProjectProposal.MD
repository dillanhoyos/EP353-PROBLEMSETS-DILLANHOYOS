### Proposal
## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
  - WaveBlaster

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")
  - I am going to make a batch proccesor that will export Multiples files that will create Laser gun Sounds Effects with slight variances, 


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
  - I will Use Sound pipe to create this project.
  - It will be excuted thru the Terminal.

## If you are planning to combine EP-353's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to EP-353, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
  - This project is only for this class.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
## In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
 - create a Sound library by compiling the different sounds one by onne

## In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
 - I can create a processor that can make 50 different Laser gun FX.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
Need to research Soundpipe and a way to randomize the parameters to create variance on this files.
