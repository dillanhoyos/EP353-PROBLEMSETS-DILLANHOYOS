### Proposal
## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
  - WaveBlaster

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")
  - I want to make a synthesizer that can create scifi weapon sounds. It will be a Wave Table Synthesizer that can create sounds that resemble Sci Fi weapon sounds or different SFX that would help me with my Sound Design. 


## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
  - I will use PortAudio, PortMIDI, and Soundpipe to create a synthesizer. It will be able to take Midi input, and it will be able to read a WaveTable to create different types of sounds. It will Have an ADSR envelope and 2 modulation inputs.
  - It will be excuted thru the Terminal.

## If you are planning to combine EP-353's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to EP-353, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
  - This project is only for this class.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
## In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?
 - I can accomplish a basic synthesizer that can be played with Midi input, the extra features such as an ADSR Envelope and Modulation sources can come second. 

## In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?
 - I can create a Wavetable synthesizer with a library of presets ready to be played. Including the ADSR envelope and the 2 Modulation Sources.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
 I need to research how to use PortAudio, PortMidi and SoundPipe. also I need to research how to make a wavetable synthesizer. How can I create an Envelope and a Modulation Source for this Synthesizer.
