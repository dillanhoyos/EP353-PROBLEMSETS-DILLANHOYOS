 * Problemset5.1.c
 * Problemset5.2.c
 * Problemset5.3.c

### Purpose
To Understand fundamental concepts on Arrays, Strings and Command-Line Arguments.
### Description
The ProblemSet #5.1 covered how to use the reverse an array so the index would be modified, I had to create two variables to change the index of the array and then reverse one to link it back to the main array. 
The ProblemSet# 5.2 covered how to count how many letters where there in a string using a function. I created a count function and assigned the value with getchar and scanf. after that it would return how many letters where in a string.
The ProblemSet #5.3 covered how to use comman-line Arguments. I used two extra variables to assign int (length of string) and int  (number of letters) to it by converting argv[1][2] into an integer using the atoi, then used those numbers to create an index for loop, that affected the to output only the requested letters

### ProblemSets 

 * Problemset5.1.c = array Print out the result using printf(). An example output of the first three lines is:

                                                                        The value of arr at index 0 is 3
                                                                        The value of arr at index 1 is 8
                                                                        The value of arr at index 2 is 4

 * Problemset5.2.c = String Print out the result using printf. Here's an example output:

                                                                        A string "Hello, World!" has 3 'l's.


 * Problemset5.3.c = Command-line Arguments     If the user inputs "Hello, World!" and 3 as arguments, your program should print out the following:

                                                                        The last 3 characters of "Hello, World" is "ld!".

### Build and Run commands
For Problemset 5.1 and 5.2, clang the file in the Terminal and then ./a.out so see the results.
clang file.c
To run the compiled file program, use:

./a.out


For ProblemSet 5.3 clang the file in terminal and then ./a.out (string) (number).

### Acknowledgment 

for ProblemSet5.1 i Used the algorithm from https://www.w3resource.com/c-programming-exercises/basic-declarations-and-expressions/c-programming-basic-exercises-51.php
